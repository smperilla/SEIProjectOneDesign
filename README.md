#Celebrity News Website

A news website that takes in keywords and returns the most recent news artices. However, the results add the keyword "celebrity" to every search – so it's limited to gossip, celebrity news! There is a fun carousel to show the top three articles.

Examples:
Enter: Chicago
Website Searches through news sites for "chicago" + "celebrity"

Enter: Cooking (example)
Website Searches through news sites for "cooking" + "celebrity"
